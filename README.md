# tcl-crimp-spec

This RPM spec is used to create a openSUSE RPM for [CRIMP](https://core.tcl.tk/akupries/crimp/home).

CRIMP is based on [critcl](http://andreas-kupries.github.io/critcl/).
The C Raster Image Manipulation Package, CRIMP provides image manipulation
and processing commands for Tcl which are mostly independent of Tk.
